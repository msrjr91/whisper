# whisper

Whisper is a social media app centered around giving users words of wisdom or general advice. Users of whisper will be allowed to post a question focused on career, relationship, finances, etc. which can be posted to the general public for private network for responses. 

## Basic Functions (MVP)
- Users should be able to register and log in
- Users should be able to post a question or dilemma
- Users should be able to respond to posts from other users
- Users should be able to follow other users
- Pages should have conditional rendering based on followers

 ## Goals
 - Help users navigate a certain challenge they may be facing
 - Allow for networking
 - Create a safe space for users
 
 ## Additional Functions (Future Stretch Goals)
 - Users should be able to decide to post publicly or privately to their network of trusted "advisors"
 - Allow posts to be in the form of a poll
 - Responses should have a liked or disliked by other users functionality to let the poster guage which "advice" is best
 - Show data visualization for posts made or contributions made
 - Users should be able to DM one another
 - Create a chat group functionality

 ### Building Credibility
- Giving advice should warrant some sort of karma score
  - Users that give good advice can be given karma points by the original poster
  - Accumulating karma points will yield a greater reputation within the Whisper community
  - Top "advisors" will be rewarded with a spotlight on the homepage of "top advisors of the month" section
